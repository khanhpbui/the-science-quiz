As soon as the user lands on the page, they'll be faced with the ultimate decision - to either kick off the quiz and put their knowledge to the test, or check out the leaderboard to see how they measure up against others. <br> Once the quiz is underway, the timer starts ticking and questions are served up one by one for the user to tackle. But wait, there's more! A handy little comment will pop up after each answer to let the user know whether they're a genius or need to hit the books a little harder. <br> Beware though, every time an incorrect answer is given, 15 precious seconds will be shaved off the clock - the pressure is on! Finally, when the user completes the quiz, they can proudly save their name and score to see where they rank on the highscore list, which is proudly displayed in the browser. <br> Good luck!
